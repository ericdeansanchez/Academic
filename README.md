## A few of my favorite academic projects

## Ants

#### Description:

```json
{
  "author" : "ericdeansanchez@berkeley.edu",
  "language" : "python",
  "course" : "cs61a",
  "notes" : "Emphasis on OOP (though the course emphasis was recursive + functional" 
}
```

Fun game so loosely inspired by another game that it's totally cool!

## NBody

#### Description:


```json
{
  "author" : "ericdeansanchez@berkeley.edu",
  "language" : "java",
  "course" : "cs61b",
  "notes" : "Fun physics refresher!" 
}
```


Simulates nbodies in our solar system (in two dimensions).

## Percolation

#### Description:

```json
{
  "author" : "ericdeansanchez@berkeley.edu",
  "language" : "java",
  "course" : "cs61b",
  "notes" : "if sites are independently set to be open with probability p 
             (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p), what is the 
             probability that the system percolates?" 
}
```

A program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. I am the sole author of Percolation.java and of PercolationStats.java.

###### What does it do?
Well, it tells you whether or not a system percolates of course! It also is robust against/preventing backwash!

>Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom or the oil to gush through to the surface)?

## Maps

#### Description:

```json
{
  "author" : "ericdeansanchez@berkeley.edu",
  "language" : "python",
  "course" : "cs61a",
  "notes" : "k-means is easier to implement than one might think!" 
}
```

This was a pretty fun project. I have labeled the pieces of code in which I am the sole author with @ezds. [Here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa18/proj/maps/) is the link to the spec.

###### What does it do?
I created a visualization of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic data set. In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star). The visualization is what is called a Voronoi diagram.

###### Just Cool
>In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual to its Delaunay triangulation. - wikipedia
